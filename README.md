## Winner Selection

The winner will be determined by whomever solves all three problems using the LEAST number of characters! Your score will be determined by the number of characters in each solution added up, and the player with the LOWEST score will win!

## Important Rules

- Any problem NOT solved will be scored at 10,000 characters
- You may use ANY programming language, however you will need to show your solution successfully running to recieve credit
- You CANNOT import any non-default libraries. (e.g. you can use the os library in python but you cannot use numpy)
