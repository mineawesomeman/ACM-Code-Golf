# English Monarch

## Problem Statement

Write a program that takes a calendar year between 927 and 2022 as an input. The code will then output whether the ruler of England at the time was a King, Queen, or Neither.

### Dates

England had a King between these dates: 927-1553, 1603-1649, 1660-1702, 1714-1837, 1901-1952, 2022

England had a Queen between these dates: 1553-1603, 1689-1694, 1702-1714, 1837-1901, 1952-2022

England had neither a King or Queen between these dates: 1650-1659

## Input

The program takes in any number from 927 to 2022, inclusive. Reminder, you do NOT need to do any form of input validation. This input can be in any form (stdin, program arguments, etc).

## Output

The output needs to be distinguishable between 'King', 'Queen', and 'Neither'. One example could be the program outputs 'k' for king, 'q' for queen, and 'n' for neither. This could be done either through stdout or an exit code!
